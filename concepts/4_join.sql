/*
FULL JOIN : Which combines the results of a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN, including all records from both tables, even if thereâ€™s no match between them. This query will work as long as your database supports FULL JOIN. 
-- However, MySQL does not natively support FULL JOIN. If you're running this in MySQL, you'll encounter an error.
*/

-- If FULL JOIN is Supported (e.g., PostgreSQL):
SELECT bands.id AS ID,
    bands.name AS band_name,
    albums.id AS album_id,
    albums.name AS album_name,
    albums.band_id
FROM bands
FULL JOIN albums ON bands.id = albums.band_id;

-- Fix for MySQL (if  FULL JOIN not supported)
SELECT bands.id AS ID,
       bands.name AS band_name,
       albums.id AS album_id,
       albums.name AS album_name,
       albums.band_id
FROM bands
LEFT JOIN albums ON bands.id = albums.band_id

UNION

/*
A CROSS JOIN in SQL produces the Cartesian product of two tables, meaning every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table. It does not require a joining condition.

Key Points:
- Row Combinations: If table1 has m rows and table2 has n rows, the result will have m * n rows.
- No ON Clause: Unlike other joins, CROSS JOIN does not use an ON condition.
- Use Cases: Generating combinations (e.g., pairing all items with all dates).
Performing operations like permutations.

- Equivalent Using Comma: This also produces a Cartesian product but is considered less readable than CROSS JOIN.

/*
SELF JOIN : A self-join in SQL is when a table is joined with itself. This allows you to compare rows within the same table. It is often used to find relationships within hierarchical data or to compare rows in scenarios like finding duplicates or pairs.
